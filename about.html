    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p><strong>EduEase AJK</strong> is an independent educational technology project created to empower
    government school teachers of Azad Jammu & Kashmir with easy-to-use digital tools. The platform focuses
    on automating everyday academic tasks such as lesson planning, student performance tracking, and question
    paper generation — helping educators save time and improve teaching efficiency.</p>

    <h2>Why EduEase?</h2>
    <p>Many teachers in AJK work in resource-constrained environments with limited digital infrastructure.
    EduEase was developed as a lightweight, browser-based solution that works even offline using local
    storage — no logins, no servers, and no complex setup. It is designed to be practical, simple,
    and accessible for every teacher.</p>

    <h2>Development & Credits</h2>
    <p>The platform is being developed as a community-led initiative by independent developers and education
    professionals passionate about digital transformation in the public education sector. EduEase is a
    non-government, non-commercial educational support project.</p>
