    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p><strong>EduEase AJK</strong> is an independent educational technology initiative created to empower
    government school teachers of Azad Jammu & Kashmir with efficient digital tools.
    The platform aims to automate routine academic tasks such as lesson planning, question paper generation,
    student record keeping, and performance tracking — enabling educators to focus more on teaching and innovation.</p>

    <h2>Why EduEase?</h2>
    <p>Teachers in AJK face diverse challenges — from limited digital resources to heavy administrative workloads.
    EduEase was designed as a lightweight, browser-based solution that works smoothly even without internet access,
    using local storage instead of cloud servers. This makes it accessible, secure, and practical for teachers
    across both urban and rural schools.</p>

    <h2>Development & Credits</h2>
    <p>The platform is being developed as a <strong>community-led initiative</strong> by independent developers,
    teachers, and education professionals passionate about digital transformation in the public education sector.
    EduEase AJK is a <strong>non-government, non-commercial educational support project</strong> — built purely
    to serve educators and enhance digital inclusion.</p>
